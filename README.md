# AirBnB Clone â€“ Project

## Overview
This project is an educational, full-stack clone of core Airbnb features. It focuses on building a clean domain model, RESTful APIs, a responsive UI, and integrating authentication, persistence, and testing.

## Project Goals
- Model users, listings, availability, bookings, and reviews
- Implement secure authentication & authorization
- Build search & filtering for listings (location, dates, guests)
- Support booking flows and simple payments mock
- Ensure data persistence with migrations & validation
- Add automated tests and CI
- Package with Docker and deploy to a cloud host

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React (Vite), React Router
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.x)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy (Alembic for migrations)
- **Auth:** JWT-based auth
- **Testing:** Pytest, Vitest/RTL
- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions
